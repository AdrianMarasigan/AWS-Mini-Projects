# Image Processing with AWS Lambda and S3

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a serverless image processing pipeline using AWS Lambda and S3. The Lambda function automatically processes images uploaded to an S3 bucket, performing tasks such as resizing, format conversion, or adding watermarks.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- AWS account with the necessary permissions to create Lambda functions, S3 buckets, and IAM roles.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with the appropriate credentials.

## Setup

### 1. Create an S3 Bucket

- Log in to the AWS Management Console.
- Navigate to the S3 service.
- Create a new bucket to store the images.

### 2. Create an IAM Role

- In the IAM service, create a new role with permissions for AWS Lambda to access S3.
- Attach the role to your Lambda function later.

### 3. Create a Lambda Function

- Navigate to the Lambda service.
- Create a new Lambda function.
- Choose the runtime (e.g., Python, Node.js) based on your preference.
- Configure the function to use the IAM role created earlier.

### 4. Define the Lambda Function Code

- Write code that utilizes a library like Pillow (Python) or Sharp (Node.js) for image processing.
- Refer to the provided sample code in the README or create your own based on your image processing requirements.

### 5. Configure S3 Trigger

- In the Lambda function settings, add an S3 trigger.
- Choose the bucket and set the event type (e.g., Object Created).

## Usage

1. Upload an image to the S3 bucket.
2. Observe the Lambda function automatically processing the image.

## Additional Notes

- Customize the image processing logic in the Lambda function based on your specific use case.
- Ensure that your Lambda function has the necessary permissions to read from and write to the S3 bucket.
