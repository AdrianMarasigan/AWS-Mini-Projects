# Serverless Email Notifications with AWS Lambda and Amazon SES

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a serverless function using AWS Lambda to send email notifications through Amazon SES. The Lambda function can be triggered by various events, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for email notifications in a serverless environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with Amazon SES access.
- Verified email addresses in Amazon SES that will be used as senders.
- Basic understanding of AWS Lambda and its configuration.

## Setup

1. **Create an Amazon SES Account:**
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the Amazon SES service.
   - Set up and verify your SES account, and then request production access.

2. **Verify Email Addresses:**
   - In the SES dashboard, verify the email addresses you want to use as senders (e.g., your email address).

3. **Create a Lambda Function:**
   - Navigate to the Lambda service.
   - Create a new Lambda function.
   - Choose the runtime (e.g., Node.js, Python).
   - Configure the function to have permissions to send emails using SES.

4. **Define the Lambda Function Code:**
   - Write code that utilizes the AWS SDK to send emails through SES.
   - Include logic to customize the email content and recipients based on your requirements.

5. **Configure Trigger for Lambda Function:**
   - Determine the event that should trigger the email notification.
   - For example, you can use an S3 event trigger, an API Gateway, or a custom event source.

6. **Test the Function:**
   - Trigger the Lambda function by simulating the event (e.g., upload a file to S3).
   - Check the CloudWatch Logs for any errors or success messages.
   - Verify that the email is received by the specified recipient.
